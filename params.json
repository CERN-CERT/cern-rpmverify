{"name":"Cern-rpmverify","body":"### Description\r\ncern-rpmverify is designed to detect changes in the files that are installed by rpm packages.\r\nIt will log the changed files as well as the rpm packages that they belong at the local syslog facility.\r\nConfiguration files are ignored, because they are supposed to be changed. You need root priviledges to execute\r\ncern-rpmverify, otherwise all the files that need root privileges will be ignored.\r\n\r\n*IMPORTANT*\r\n\r\nIf you want to run a more strict rpm verification, execute 'rpm -V --all'. With this command you will\r\nget information about not only changed files, but changes in permissions etc.\r\n\r\n### Format of the log messages\r\nFeb  9 14:50:23 localhost python: cern-rpmverify: started\r\nFeb  9 15:04:02 localhost python: rpmverify: File /usr/bin/catchsegv from package glibc-common-2.12-1.47.el6 has been modified\r\nFeb  9 15:04:04 localhost python: rpmverify: File /usr/bin/consolehelper from package usermode-1.102-3.el6 has been modified\r\nFeb  9 14:55:15 localhost python: cern-rpmverify: finished\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n<a href=\"mailto:cert@cern.ch?Subject=Netlog%20support/contact\">\r\nCERN CERT</a>","tagline":"Verifies the integrity of the files which are installed by rpm packages","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

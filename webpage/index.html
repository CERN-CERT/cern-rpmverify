        <h3>Description</h3>

<p>cern-rpmverify is designed to detect changes in the files that are installed by rpm packages.
It will log the changed files as well as the rpm packages that they belong at the local syslog facility.
Configuration files are ignored, because they are supposed to be changed. You need root priviledges to execute
cern-rpmverify, otherwise all the files that need root privileges will be ignored.</p>

<h4>IMPORTANT</h4>

<p>If you want to run a more strict rpm verification, execute 'rpm -V --all'. With this command you will
get information about not only changed files, but changes in permissions etc.</p>

<h3>Format of the log messages</h3>

<pre><code>
Feb  9 14:50:23 localhost python: cern-rpmverify: started
